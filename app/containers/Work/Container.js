              After a while using Redux, I became frustrated with the
              overly-verbose and repetitive nature of its components. I,
              therefore, wrote some helpers to reduce the repetitiveness, and
              eventually, they grew into a complete library for generating redux
              components from a single source of truth. Because of the organic
              way in which I built this from the ground up, the library is
              completely interoperable with hand-coded redux components, meaning
              that it can be adopted gradually in an existing codebase using
              redux.

          <SubSection name="EPICC Conference">
            <Paragraph>
              For a non-profit conference running in Southampton, I developed a
              website where delegates could reserve and pay for tickets. The
              website also allowed us to collect information needed from
              delegates, and a QR-code based ticket system was implemented to
              quickly register delegates when arriving at the conference.
              <br />
              <br />
              The stack was as follows: React front-end, Node backend, Redis DB,
              Stripe payment handling, Travis CI and Heroku deployment.
              <br />
              <br />
              The custom-built solution allowed us to sell nearly 120 tickets
              with lower fees than other event/ticket selling products, allowed
              delegates to manage their own tickets and enabled the conference
              committee to instantly admit users with valid tickets to the
              conference using a browser-based QR code scanner.

              . My work there involved maintaining large .NET frameworks which
              supported feature-rich mission analysis tools. Close collaboration
              with the hardware team and our consumers was essential and
              demanded a strong, agile approach to development. Thorough
              planning, in which we were all involved, was key to our success.
              Throughout some 60 weeks there, I immensely improved my ability to
              navigate large codebases and to produce readable, manageable code
              myself.
