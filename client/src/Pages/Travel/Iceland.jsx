        In January we kicked off the year in style by heading to Iceland for 6 nights. We booked the
        whole package through Iceland Air, which made it pretty easy to bolt together an
        action-packed trip. We stayed in a small no-frills hotel just outside Reykjavík (about a 30
        min walk to the city centre). As well as exploring the city and trying their restaurants, we
        also fitted in trips to see the Northern Lights by boat, a visit to Blue Lagoon, a
        whale-watching boat trip and a tour of the Golden Circle.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iceland is an incredibly beautiful country, with a lot of natural wonders that you can't see
        anywhere else. Despite getting food-poisoning on day 1, it was an awesome trip and I'd
        definitely recommend a visit!
