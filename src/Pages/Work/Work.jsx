        <SubSection name="Where it all started">
              I started my Software Engineering career at <TextLink href="http://www.leonardocompany.com/en/-/ewos-electronic_warfare_operational_support" external>Leonardo</TextLink> where I worked for 60 weeks, mainly on a .NET analysis framework which supported other development teams in building powerful applications.
        <br />
          <br />
        I then moved on to become a Software Engineering intern at Skyscanner, where I worked on their open-source design system, <TextLink href="https://backpack.github.io/" external>Backpack</TextLink>. I continued this work whilst completing my Masters in Southampton. Once my Masters is out of the way, I will be rejoining Skyscanner as a full-time employee.

        <Section name="Portfolio">
              This website demonstrates some of my web-development capabilities. Below I have included examples and extracts from my work on open-source products.

          <SubSection name="Password Character Extractor">
                I found the login process for a number of sites (particularly UK bank websites) frustrating as they often require specific characters from a password or memorable word. This is something that LastPass cannot handle for me, so I created an offline tool to help.
