      <Section name="About me">
          I&apos;m an open-source software engineer at Skyscanner, passionate about design, travel and photography. When I&apos;m not internationally photobombing unsuspecting strangers I&apos;m based somewhere between Southampton and London.
        <br />
        <br />
        I recently got engaged whilst whale-watching in Iceland üíç (see below)!
        <br />
        <br />
        I enjoy getting outdoors and trying new things, and will be completeing my 5th Tough Mudder in May 2018. I also try to squeeze in as much volunteering as I can, so you may find me dressed as a Help for Heroes bear, reviewing content for Beat, or submitting PR's to Mozilla's open-source. I look forward to doing more of all that when I finish my Masters.
        <br />
        <br />

            I&apos;m not usually one to blow my own trumpet, but recent achievements of note include my Masters in Software Engineering and Grade 8 on the flute.
