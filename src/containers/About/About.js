          This site is built in React and hosted on Heroku where I have a Redis
          database provisioned. Redux is used to invoke API functions when pages
          are server-side rendered, and also when calls are made from the
          browser.
          <br />I use this site to experiment with things, share stuff I've
          figured out, and allow people to reach-out to me. So if you're
          interested in anything I do,{" "}
