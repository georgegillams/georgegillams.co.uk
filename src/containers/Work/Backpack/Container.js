          A highlight has been delivering Skyscannerâ€™s new brand across all our products, leveraging the coverage of
          Backpack libraries to enable seamless experimentation and roll-out across the entire ecosystem. We made use of
          CSS variables for web and Appearance proxies for iOS) to allow us to swap &quot;themes&quot; at runtime. This
          allowed teams to test every part of their UI was responding to theming long before the new brand was
          finalised. When the new brand was signed off, we were able to easily add a new theme and control its rollout
          to users remotely.

          Leveraging some of the same techniques used to deliver the new brand, we recently rolled out Dark Mode support
          across iOS, Android and React Native. It was great to deliver such an important traveller-first feature as
          quickly as we managed too, and we used the opportunity to bake accessible colour contrast into the dark-mode
          designs. We also redefined our elevation language for both light and dark mode while we were at it to allow us
          to move as quickly as possible.
